## What is a Sounds Library?
 
A sounds library is a collection of audio samples that are used to play back your music notation. Each sample represents a specific instrument, playing technique, articulation, or effect. For example, a violin sample might include different bowings, vibrato, pizzicato, harmonics, etc.
 
A sounds library can vary in size, quality, and diversity. Some libraries are very large and detailed, offering hundreds of instruments and thousands of samples. Others are smaller and simpler, focusing on a few essential sounds. Some libraries are specialized for certain genres or styles, such as orchestral, jazz, rock, or world music.
 
A sounds library can also vary in format and compatibility. Some libraries are designed to work with specific software or hardware, such as Kontakt, HALion, or SoundFont. Others are more universal and can be used with any program that supports MIDI or audio files.
  
## What are the Options for Sibelius 7?
